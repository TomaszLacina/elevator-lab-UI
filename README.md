Missing features and TODO list on UI SIDE
	* add data validation (negative numbers and 0 doesn't make any sense)
	* make application components more fine grained for example, instead of having table with floor label, buttons, and elevator status, create component for Floor, FloorLabel, ButtonPanel, Button, Elevator. 
	* add better CSS styles, so it looks like more MVP than PoC
	* User yarn instead of npm, maybe then node_modules would be smaller
	
	I was learning react when creating this project, so even though it is not complete, I am a little bit satisfied with it.
